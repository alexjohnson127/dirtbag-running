# Dirtbag Running

This project is to create the front end of a website that allows a user to generate a smart run training plan based on their current fitness and goals. I have previously developed an app for this function, but I am refining and improving it here. 

Key Features:
-Training plan generation
-Input on how to run cheaper
-Race reviews/blogs

Future goal: create a site that allows a user to log races and showcase them, almost like a highlight reel. Allowing me to learn more about working with the backend.
