                <h2 className='question'>Okay, so then why is it named "Dirtbag Running"? What does it mean?</h2>
                <p className='answer'>No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. Gets the people going. </p>
                <p className='answer'>Truthfully, the name is inspired by the "dirtbags" who build their life around their passion(think ski/surf bum). Most people do not live the "bum" or "dirtbag" lifestyle, but the carefree flow state of mind is closer than you think. Running offers a way to focus on a singular thing for a little bit each day. You get to forget about other stressors and focus on a pursuit that is meaningful to you. </p>
                <p className='answer'>Experienced runners know that chasing down goals is extremely fulfilling. The more you put into running, the more you get back from it. You don't need to be fast or even be a "runner" to benefit from the pursuit of a running goal. If you're a new runner, pick a goal and stick to it. It could be as simple as "I want to run a full mile within the next month". You won't regret it, and you may find yourself becoming more and more of a "Dirtbag Runner". </p>

                <p className='question'>Sounds pretty sweet, how do I get in on this?</p>
                <p className='answer'>You too can be a dirtbag in as little as 20 minutes per day. All you need is some shoes (no, not the $300 Nikes you saw on TV), and a plan. That's where Dirtbag Running comes in. Sure, you could pay someone to coach you. Or you could buy a premade training plan online. But you're a dirtbag baby! You don't wanna pay someone $100+ per month, but you also don't want a generic plan that doesn't allow you to truly reach your potential. Dirtbag Running meets you where you are and helps you identify the best training plan possible. Right now it's completely free to use the training plan tool. All I ask is that you share this site with friends,family,and fellow dirtbags. Eventually, this will be monetized, but how that looks is yet to be determined.</p>
