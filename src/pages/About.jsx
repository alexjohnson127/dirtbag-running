                <h2 className='question'>Dude! What the H-E-Double Hockey Sticks is Dirtbag Running?</h2>

                <h2 className='question'>Okay, so then why is it named "Dirtbag Running"? What does it mean?</h2>
                <p className='answer'>No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. Gets the people going. </p>
                <p className='answer'>Truthfully, the name is inspired by the "dirtbags" who build their life around their passion(think ski/surf bum). Most people do not live the "bum" or "dirtbag" lifestyle, but the carefree flow state of mind is closer than you think. Running offers a way to focus on a singular thing for a little bit each day. You get to forget about other stressors and focus on a pursuit that is meaningful to you. </p>
                <p className='answer'>Experienced runners know that chasing down goals is extremely fulfilling. The more you put into running, the more you get back from it. You don't need to be fast or even be a "runner" to benefit from the pursuit of a running goal. If you're a new runner, pick a goal and stick to it. It could be as simple as "I want to run a full mile within the next month". You won't regret it, and you may find yourself becoming more and more of a "Dirtbag Runner". </p>

                <p className='question'>Sounds pretty sweet, how do I get in on this?</p>
                <p className='answer'>You too can be a dirtbag in as little as 20 minutes per day. All you need is some shoes (no, not the $300 Nikes you saw on TV), and a plan. That's where Dirtbag Running comes in. Sure, you could pay someone to coach you. Or you could buy a premade training plan online. But you're a dirtbag baby! You don't wanna pay someone $100+ per month, but you also don't want a generic plan that doesn't allow you to truly reach your potential. Dirtbag Running meets you where you are and helps you identify the best training plan possible. Right now it's completely free to use the training plan tool. All that's asked of you is that you share this site with friends,family,and fellow dirtbags. Eventually, this will be monetized, but how that looks is yet to be determined.</p>

                <p className='question'>Man, whoever made this site must be really cool, I bet people are really stoked on him.</p>
                <p className='answer'>This site was built by Alex Johnson, who is actually not that cool. This is evidenced by the fact that he spent his free time building a React App to make training plans. He is really passionate about running though. In high school he ran cross country and track for Neuqua Valley under the legendary Coach Steen. In college, he attempted to walk onto the Purdue University team but didn't make the cut. He was fortunate enough to find the running club at Purdue, where he met some of his best friends. Alex coached the club his junior and senior year. With over 100 active members he learned about managing a wide variety of individual goals.</p>
                <p className='answer'>Since graduating college, Alex has been writing his own training as well as providing plans for friends and family. He mainly races ultramarathons, and he would love to help you train for ultramarathons as well! Recent results include a win at the Salt Lake City Marathon with a time of 2:32:18, as well as a podium finish at the DC Peaks 50 Miler. </p>
